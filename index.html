    <p>
      That's me! I'm a student of the arcane art of computer science at UCLA, double-majoring in the slightly-less-arcane art of math-economics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply put, I have two passions - computers and helping people - and ideally, I'd like to use computers to empower people.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the realm of computers, I <span class="fa fa-heart animated-heartbeat" style="color:red;" aria-label="love"></span> making things with software (websites, apps, backends, servers, embedded systems, open-source software), and am generally fascinated by computers.
    </p>
    <p>
      My favourite way to help people is through education and outreach; STEM &amp; computer science are my bread and butter, and I <em>mostly</em> like working with kids. More broadly, I like doing things that make a direct impact in people's lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time, I like to read (usually about economics and political philosophy), <a rel="noopener" target="_blank"
        href="https://open.spotify.com/user/11156788800">listen to music</a>, and <a rel="noopener" target="blank"
        href="https://blog.matthewwang.me">write a bad blog</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And come up with mediocre puns.

          <li>Fabricated data packets to disable devices and spoof GPS, navigation, AIS, autopilot (C)</li>
          <li>Developed GUI to control embedded system over TCP (React, Electron)</li>

          learn how to code. I'm the project director and a lead developer, which lets me juggle dev and project

    <h1>Skills</h1>
    <p>
      I am sometimes good at things. Usually involves computers.
    </p>
    <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
    <p>
      Relevant skills:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Strongest Languages: Javascript, Python, C, C++</li>
      <li>Theory: Data Structures, Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, Design Patterns </li>
      <li>Rusty Languages: Swift, PHP, Java, Objective-C, Ruby</li>
      <li>Task-running (make, rake, grunt) &amp; Testing (Enzyme, Google Lighthouse)</li>
      <li>Continuous Integration &amp; Deployment (Travis, AppVeyor, GitHub Actions)</li>
      <li>I <span class="fa fa-heart animated-heartbeat" style="color:red;"></span> using git &amp; GitHub</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I love writing code, but moreover I take it very seriously. Specifically, I care a lot about writing extensible
      and maintainable code. Part of that comes from a solid understanding of programming languages and design paradigms
      (which I think I'm at least <em>alright</em> at ðŸ˜‰). Part of that comes from practicing software engineering
      skills: I check GitHub more than Instagram, and I make it a point to document as much of what I do as possible.
      I've been lucky to have many opportunities to collaborate with others, especially in the open-source community, to
      continually improve my code.
    </p>
    <h2>Full Stack Development</h2>
    <p>
      Relevant skills:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Frontend Javascript: React + Redux, Angular, jQuery, Electron</li>
      <li>Web App Frameworks: Express, Django, Flask</li>
      <li>Databases: SQL, Firebase, key-value &amp; document-based noSQL</li>
      <li>Generic Languages: Javascript, Python, PHP, C, C++</li>
      <li>App Development: Swift (and iOS Deployment), Ionic + Cordova</li>
      <li>Misc: Jekyll, Webservers (Nginx, Apache), HTML + CSS, SASS, Google Analytics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I know my way around web development and a big chunk of its massive ecosystem. I prefer minimal frontends and code
      so the user and developer aren't overwhelmed. Even though I'm proficient in many of the new trendy Javascript
      frameworks, I'm willing to stand by vanilla JS: MV* frameworks aren't always needed! I'm a strong believer that
      servers are built on battle-tested and reliable code: I try to not reinvent the wheel, and think that the best way
      to spend backend time is to pick the right design pattern and library.
    </p>
    <h2>Education &amp; Outreach</h2>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about education and outreach, and what I do shows it. At UCLA, I'm heavily involved in two clubs:
      BEAM, which focuses on teaching STEM to underserved elementary kids in LA; and ACM Teach LA, to empower students
      with the wonders of computer science. At the UCLA MakerSpace, I place a big emphasis on demystifying scary
      machines and teaching people how to make awesome things. In high school I started a couple of educational programs
      aimed at bringing computer science and robotics to underprivileged students in Toronto.

      <h2>UCLA MakerSpace (2019-*)</h2>
      <p><b>Lead Technician</b></p>
      <p>
        At UCLA's MakerSpace, I help other students create awesome things using laser cutters, 3D printers,
        microcontrollers, and wood working machines, among other things. In addition to supervising the space and
        helping people who come in, I also teach classes and maintain the equipment. I also do some administrative
        things as a lead technician, including expanding the space as a place for sales and services.
      </p>
      <h2>ACM Teach LA (2018-*)</h2>
      <p><b>Project Director, Developer</b></p>
      <p>
        ACM Teach LA is a nonprofit organization that teaches computer science to underserved students in the Greater
        Los Angeles area. I'm involved in two major different way. First, I lead the dev team, where we create an online
        IDE that allow our students to develop, run, and save
        code online; the project is developed with a Node-heavy ecosystem of React, Redux, Express, and Firebase. You
        can read <a href="#tla">this absurdly long list</a> for more info, or <a

      </p>
      <p>
        I also occasionally blab about machine learning and AI to North Hollywood High School, and help with the club's
        curriculum development and day-to-day operations.

      <h2>AudioNotch (2017)</h2>
      <p><b>Software Development Intern</b></p>

      <h2>BEAM (2018-*)</h2>
      <p>
        Building Engineers and Mentors (BEAM) is a science outreach club devoted to promoting science and engineering to
        underserved kids in the LA area. As a member, I run weekly STEM workshops and develop lessons and curriculum
        throughout the school year.
      </p>
      <h2>Horizons Robotics &amp; Computer Science (2014-2018)</h2>
      <p>
        As the program director of Horizons Robotics, I developed and taught a 4-week curriculum (using mBots, Scratch,
        and Makey-Makeys) taught to 100+ underserved middle-school students in Toronto. I also procured inventory and
        trained student instructors. Similarly, as the program director and founder of Horizons Computer Science, I
        designed a 4-week curriculum (centred on Scratch), procured inventory and trained instructors, and led classes.
