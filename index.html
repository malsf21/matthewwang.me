									I love computers. Ever since I got my first one in Grade Two (A 2004 IBM ThinkPad on Windows XP!) I've been fascinated by them. Now, I try my best to harness that power into some pretty cool stuff! I do a lot of web development: I've made websites of every kind, including portfolio websites, <a href="https://github.com/FYCompsci/TwitHalf">social media sites</a>, conference websites (for <a href="http://world.ac">WAC</a> and <a href="http://omun.ca">OMUN), <a href="http://pc.ucc.on.ca">sports league websites</a>, <a href="http://blog.matthewwang.me">my blog</a>, and a plethora of other projects. I've also developed <a href="https://github.com/malsf21/omun-app">a conference app</a>, <a href="https://github.com/malsf21/ping">a few</a> <a href="https://github.com/FYCompsci/ScrumHalf">games</a>, and a bunch of other things you can find <a href="https://github.com/malsf21">on my GitHub page</a>. I've scored perfect on the Junior CCC, and placed top 8 in our ECOO Regionals.  In addition, I'm the head of our school's <a href="http://robotics.ucc.on.ca">Robotics Club</a>, teaching kids at UCC the entire engineering workflow starting from prototyping to winning competitions. I also participate in Horizons Robotics, a non-profit organization dedicated to teaching the things that made me passionate about technology to underpriveleged kids all over Toronto. I also moonlight as an A/V associate, doing small work for my school and the World Affairs Conference.

								<p class="lead">
								 	Due to my love of Computer Science and Engineering, I'm also heavily interested in <i>current</i> affairs and public speaking. I compete in our school's debate team: I've won speaker awards at Hart House (UofT), McGill, York, and Queens; won the McGill Juniors; went to Junior Nationals in 2015 and placed 12th Speaker; and most recently represented Canada at the International Competition of Young Debaters at Oxford, England, in 2016 and placed 6th Speaker out of over 700 international participants. I also compete in our school's Model UN team: Upper Canada College has been undefeated in 4 consecutive years, the last 2 I have participated in. In those 2 years, I've won Best Delegate at SSUNS (McGill), 2 Outstanding Delegates at BMUN (UC Berkely), and an Honourable Delegate at both HMUN (Harvard) and CMUNCE (Columbia). I've also done public speaking stints for various events at Upper Canada College, William Berczy Public School (my previous school), and local community centers.

									Great leaders and great educators helped teach me the basics of everything: science, arts, current affairs, public speaking, sports, you name it. Now, I try to give back in that very same principle. I'm the club head of <a href="http://robotics.ucc.on.ca"> UCC Robotics</a>, a club centered around educating budding engineers to create robots and computer programs that can change our world. In addition to teaching broad robotics principles, I've done soldering workshops, 1-on-1 mentoring, and programs like Horizons Robotics to educate other students in engineering. I've spread my administrative wings elsewhere: I'm the head of Registration and Media for <a href="http://world.ac">the World Affairs Conference</a>, where I coordinate registration, marketing, websites, social media, and conference promotional materials for Canada's oldest and largest student-run current affairs conference. I've held other administrative positions such as USG of Communications for <a href="http://omun.ca">Ontario Model United Nations</a>, and instructive positions such as a Horizons Math tutor.

												<h3><a href="http://world.ac">World Affairs Conference Website</a></h3>
												The World Affairs Conference is the oldest student-led conference, but that doesn't mean we have to be behind the times. I developed the <a href="http://world.ac">World Affairs Conference Website</a>, which included remaking the entire structure, content, and some server-side design. Using Jekyll, I've written a website that parses markdown files and turns it into a fully-fledged website, which makes it easily maintainable by people who don't know how to code.
												</br>
												</br>
												We still have a lot of goals ahead of us, such as online registration, plenary assignments, and delegate outreach. It's a lot of work, but you can watch our progress on the website, as well as on our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/malsf21/world.ac">GitHub repository</a>.

												<h3><a href="http://robotics.ucc.on.ca">UCC Robotics Website</a></h3>
												It'd be nice if robots could build our website for us, but technology hasn't advanced <span style="font-style:italic;">that</span> far. In the meantime, I've developed the UCC Robotics Website, which features tons (and tonnes) of content, a user system that includes messaging, achievements, and attendance, and a dynamic content-delviery system, using alerts and bulletins.
												</br>
												</br>
												Unfortunately, not all of those features are polished, and there's still a lot of work to do. You can track our progress on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/malsf21/robotics-club-website">the GitHub Repository</a>, and even contribute via <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/malsf21/robotics-club-website/issues">issue tracking</a> or through <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/malsf21/robotics-club-website/pulls">contributing code</a>.

												<h3><a href="http://pc.ucc.on.ca">Prefects Cup Website</a></h3>
												Much like Hogwarts, UCC features 10 houses filled to the brim with competitive nature. Yet, there wasn't one centralized way to visualize the results of the vast number of competitions such as House Softball, Hockey, or Soccer: just a bunch of Google Spreadsheets, posted flyers, and assembly announcements scattered all over the place. The <a href="http://pc.ucc.on.ca">Prefects Cup Website</a>, in it's own way, tries to fix that. It features a centralized (albeit small) schedule bank, a list of all the organisers, and most importantly, an almost live-update of the position of each house.
												</br>
												</br>
												You can find the code for the website <a href="https://github.com/malsf21/prefects-cup-website/">on GitHub</a>, but I am currently making a version 2. Psssst. Go Orr's go!

												<h3><a href="http://omun.ca">Ontario Model UN Website</a></h3>
												Model United Nations Conferences are one of my favourite extracurricular events: you spend several days debating key issues that affect the globe, such as world hunger, the Middle East, or even a sudden zombie outbreak. Ontario Model United Nations is held at my school, Upper Canada College, and to help out I've designed the <a href="http://omun.ca">Ontario Model UN Website</a>, which delivers content about the conference such as scheduling, committees, and position papers.
												</br>
												</br>
												My next big goal is online registration, but that seems like a daunting hurdle. Nevertheless, I'll give it my best shot. You can keep tabs on my progress on <a href="https://github.com/malsf21/omun.ca">the GitHub Repository</a>.

												<h3><a href="https://github.com/malsf21/omun-app">Ontario Model UN App</a></h3>

At OMUN, we want to stay in the game; that's why I'm working on the <a href="https://github.com/malsf21/omun-app">Ontario Model UN App</a>. It'll feature similar information as the website, as well as additional news blasts and notifications, all at the tip of your fingers.
												</br>
												</br>
												The OMUN App is developed using web technologies, so it'll be available on Android and iOS soon. Expect something after summer break! You can keep up on my progress on <a href="https://github.com/malsf21/omun-app">the GitHub Repository</a>.

In addition to blogging, I use this blog as a test for <b>Jekyll</b>, a static-site generator; the entire blog is mostly markdown files and some templating!

				<h1 class="page-header">Skills</h1>
				<h2>Web Design</h2>
				<p>I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as frameworks like <a target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Making websites like this portfolio, <a target="_blank" href="http://world.ac/">the WAC website</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://robotics.ucc.on.ca">the UCC Robotics Website</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://omun.ca">the OMUN website</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/malsf21">and more</a>, is something I have a lot of experience with. </p>

				<h2>Application Development</h2>
				<p>
				Application development is what connects users and producers. I've developed desktop applications with <a target="_blank" href="http://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a>, a node-based platform for creating desktop applications.</p>
				<p>
				I've also developed mobile apps; using the Ionic framework, I wrote the <a href="https://github.com/malsf21/omun-app">OMUN App</a> for iOS and Android, having both static and dynamic content display.
				</p>

				<h2>Server-side and Backend Design</h2>
				<p>I have a lot of experience in server-side languages, including PHP and SQL.  Examples of this include the <a target="_blank" href="http://world.ac/2016">WAC website</a>, my <a href="http://matthewwang.me/thebuzz">mock Social Media website</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://robotics.ucc.on.ca">robotics website</a>, and my <a target="_blank" href="http://matthewwang.me/status">Status Project</a>.</p>

				<h2>Social Media and Advertising</h2>
				<p>Getting your name known is half the battle, and that's one I've fought several times. I've managed social media accounts for the World Affairs Conference, Ontario Model United Nations and Ontario Model Parliament, as well as participated and later led advertising campaigns for the World Affairs Conference, Ontario Model United Nations, and our Robotics Club.</p>

				<h2>Graphic Design</h2>
				<p>Graphic Design is no stranger to me; I've used InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere for several years now. I do layout for our school newspaper using InDesign, and use Photoshop and Illustrator to make <a target="_blank" href="http://world.ac/2016/misc_files">resources for the World Affairs Conference</a>, Ontario Model United Nations, and other small time jobs.</p>

				<h2>Computer Hardware/Robotics</h2>
				<p>When I was younger, there was nothing better than building LEGOs! Now, I've moved onto more mechanical and engineering-based solutions. I've done small jobs including building several computers, for both myself and friends, as well as building robots in our <a target="_blank" href="http://robotics.ucc.on.ca">Robotics Club</a>. I'm also taking on some personal projects, like building my own keyboard (and subsquently <a target="_blank" href="http://robotics.ucc.on.ca/projects_keyboard.php">teaching others how to</a>).</p>

				<h2>Public Speaking</h2>
				<p>I'm a seasoned public speaker: whether it being part of the #1 Model UN team in North America, winning at McGill, Harvard and Berkely, or debating in both university and international tournaments, I have no fear of speaking to crowds (spiders now, that's another deal). I've spoken frequently at schools, camps, and at extracurricular clubs and events.</p>

				<h2>Teaching and Tutouring</h2>
				<p>Teach a man to light a fire, and he'll be warm for a day. Light a man on fire, and he'll be warm for the rest of his life! I'm more on the side of teaching: through programs like <a target="_blank" href="http://robotics.ucc.on.ca/horizons_about.php">Horizons Robotics</a>, Debating, or mentorship programs through other clubs I've done, I have experience planning out lesson plans, teaching both children and adults about topics, and conveying ideas with clear and logical public speaking skills. In addition, I've completed the LIT (Leadership in Training) program at UCC, and am a certified camp counselor.</p>

				<h2>Project Management</h2>
				<p>Dealing with all this computer science stuff is hard if there isn't any organisation and goals. I've done a lot of project management with clubs like Robotics and the World Affairs Confererence, whether it be through GitHub, in-person standup meetings, using frameworks like Agile Sprint, or using technologies such as Slack..
