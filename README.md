Hey there! This is the GitHub repository for my website, which you can find at [matthewwang.me](https://matthewwang.me)! I've written almost all of the code myself, including using a CSS framework I made called [liteweight](https://github.com/malsf21/liteweight/).

I've got to say, I've procrastinated reworking the entire website time and time again. We'll see if it ever ends up happening!

I used a compiled version of [liteweight](https://github.com/malsf21/liteweight/) called `liteweight-duo`. If you want to compile your own version with more cool features, get it from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/malsf21/liteweight/).
