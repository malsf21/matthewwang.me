Hey there! This is my (Matthew Wang's) portfolio website. It's made entirely by my own CSS + a few fonts. I'll update the website as I get new content, and I'll also document this entire process soon enough.

## Development Notes

To compile [liteweight](https://github.com/malsf21/liteweight/), run:

```bash
$ sass liteweight.scss liteweight.min.css --style=compressed
```

*[liteweight](https://github.com/malsf21/liteweight/) is a small CSS framework I made to teach myself SCSS.*
