Hey there! This is my (Matthew Wang's) portfolio website. It's made entirely by my own CSS + a few fonts. I'll update the website as I get new content, and I will try to do some documentation (but there isn't much need to).

## Development Notes

I used a compiled version of [liteweight](https://github.com/malsf21/liteweight/). If you want to compile your own version with more cool features, get it from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/malsf21/liteweight/).

*[liteweight](https://github.com/malsf21/liteweight/) is a small CSS framework I made to teach myself SCSS.*
